A warm welcome to Etherpad!

This Etherpad site is built for meetings and on going distance learning during the Corona Virus outbreak.  We will keep this instance up post the outbreak for at least 3 years.

If you want to roll your own Etherpad site then you can.  Etherpad is free and open source.  Https://etherpad.org -- All pads are fully exported with full fidelity so no content or data is lost in the move.

If this Etherpad site doesn't have the functionality you want then see the extensive list of adaptations, plugins and modifications available: https://static.etherpad.org/plugins.html
